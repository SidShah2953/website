## Overview

This advanced interdisciplinary research project combines mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, Python programming, and data analytics to solve a centuries-old archaeological problem: accurately computing volumes of ancient Greek vases using geometric principles and modern computational methods.

**Publication**: MDPI Journal (Metrology) - November 2025  
**Team**: Siddhant Shah, Minfei Liang, Eugene Pinsky  
**Affiliation**: Boston University, Department of Computer Science

## Objective

Develop an accurate, practical method for computing volumes of ancient Greek amphorae using mathematical modeling and computational methods. Enable large-scale analysis of 130,000+ vases in the Beazley Archive database to support archaeological research on ancient trade and economic activity.

## Problem Context

### Historical Significance
Ancient Greek amphorae were critical for trade and commerce, used for storing and transporting wine, olive oil, and grain. Accurate volume measurement is essential for understanding economic activity, trade patterns, and consumption estimates in antiquity.

### Technical Challenges
- Direct volume measurement is infeasible due to age and fragility of artifacts
- Many specimens are incomplete (fragments only)
- Museum preservation restrictions limit physical manipulation
- Over 130,000 vases cataloged in Beazley Archive require systematic analysis

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Dataset**: 25+ ancient Greek amphorae from Boston Museum of Fine Arts
- **Source**: Lacey Caskey's measurements from "A Geometry of Greek Vases" (1920s)
- **Metrics**: Height, width, diameter measurements, geometric ratios (Golden Ratio φ, √2, √3, √5), cross-sectional profiles

### Mathematical Modeling

**Hypothesis**: Greek vase contours follow logarithmic spiral equations based on "dynamic symmetry" principles.

**Model Components**:
- Derived closed-form mathematical formulas for volume calculation
- Developed parametric equations with parameters: α (growth rate), β (rotation), c (scaling factor), θ (angular coordinates)
- Created exact analytical solution using integral calculus for volumes of revolution

**Key Parameters**:
- α (growth rate): Range -0.13 to 0.07
- β (rotation): Range -0.06 to 0.05
- c (scaling factor): Range 0.15 to 0.24

### Statistical Analysis

Performed t-Test analysis to validate approximation methods:
- **Sample Size**: 25
- **t-statistic**: 0.66
- **p-value**: 0.52
- **Significance Level**: 95%
- **Conclusion**: Failed to reject null hypothesis, validating approximation simplifications

### Computational Implementation

**Technologies**:
- **Python** with NumPy (numerical computing) and SciPy (optimization algorithms)
- Numerical optimization and parameter estimation
- Least-squares fitting and gradient descent
- Coordinate transformation and normalization

### Approximation Methods

| Method | Mean Relative Error | Complexity | Use Case |
|--------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| Single Frustum | 15-20% | Low | Quick estimates |
| Two Frustums | 8-12% | Medium | Better accuracy |
| Semi-Ellipsoid (Optimal) | **4.91%** | Medium | Recommended for practical applications |

## Key Formula

Simplified volume formula for practical application:

**Body Volume**: V ≈ (2π/3) × (widest radius)² × (body height)  
**Neck Volume**: V_neck ≈ (3π/4) × (neck diameter)² × (neck height)  
**Total Volume**: V_total = V_body + V_neck

This formula requires only 3 basic measurements and achieves 4.91% mean relative error.

## Results

### Validation Metrics
- **Sample Size**: 25 vases
- **Accuracy Confidence**: 95%
- **Best Model Performance**: 4.91% mean relative error (semi-ellipsoid method)
- **Validation Baselines**: Compared against web-based tools (Université Libre de Bruxelles) and Getty Museum reported volumes

### Project Impact

**Academic Contribution**:
- First mathematical framework for universal Greek vase volume calculation
- Validated hypothesis connecting dynamic symmetry to logarithmic spirals
- Provided simple, historically accurate volume estimation method

**Practical Impact**:
- Enables large-scale analysis of 130,000+ vases in Beazley Archive database
- Supports archaeological research on ancient trade and economic activity
- Creates standardized methodology for museum cataloging
