## Abstract

This research explores momentum-based trading strategies applied to crude oil ETFs and futures markets. We developed long-short models that capitalize on price momentum patterns, achieving annualized returns of up to 19.9% over an 18-year testing period.

## Methodology

Our approach combines technical analysis with quantitative modeling to identify momentum signals in crude oil markets. The strategy utilizes:

- **Long-Short Framework**: Systematically identifying entry and exit points based on momentum indicators
- **Risk Management**: Implementing position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms
- **Backtesting**: Rigorous historical testing over 18 years of market data

## Key Results

- **Annualized Returns**: Up to 19.9% over the testing period
- **Market Conditions**: Strategy performance across various market regimes
- **Risk-Adjusted Performance**: Analysis of Sharpe ratios and maximum drawdowns

## Implementation

The trading system was implemented using Python with extensive backtesting on historical ETF and futures data. Performance metrics were validated across multiple market cycles.

## Conclusion

Momentum-based strategies demonstrate consistent alpha generation potential in crude oil markets when properly implemented with robust risk management protocols.
