## Abstract

This research presents a novel trading strategy that leverages overnight silver returns as a predictive signal for Bitcoin price movements. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements with lower drawdowns over a 10-year backtesting period, achieving 68.65% annualized returns.

## Motivation

The relationship between precious metals and cryptocurrency markets has been a subject of increasing interest. This study explores whether silver, as a traditional store of value, can provide predictive signals for Bitcoin trading.

## Methodology

### Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis
We analyzed the statistical relationship between overnight silver returns and subsequent Bitcoin price movements, identifying exploitable patterns in market microstructure.

### Strategy Implementation
- **Signal Generation**: Overnight silver return calculations
- **Entry/Exit Rules**: Systematic trading rules based on silver signals
- **Position Management**: Dynamic sizing based on signal strength
- **Risk Controls**: Maximum drawdown limits and volatility-adjusted positions

## Key Findings

- **Annualized Returns**: 68.65% over 10-year backtest period
- **Drawdown Reduction**: Significantly lower maximum drawdowns compared to buy-and-hold
- **Market Regime Performance**: Consistent performance across bull and bear markets
- **Risk-Adjusted Metrics**: Superior Sharpe and Sortino ratios

## Data and Backtesting

The strategy was backtested on 10 years of historical data, incorporating:
- Transaction costs and slippage
- Realistic execution assumptions
- Multiple market conditions

## Practical Considerations

Implementation details including:
- Data sources and timing
- Execution logistics
- Risk management protocols

## Conclusion

The research demonstrates that cross-asset signals from silver markets can provide valuable predictive information for Bitcoin trading. The strategy's lower drawdown profile makes it particularly attractive for risk-conscious traders.
