## Abstract

This paper presents a novel probabilistic framework for estimating the accuracy of bagged ensemble models, specifically Random Forests, without exhaustive computational evaluation. Our approach uses various probability distributions to model ensemble performance, achieving less than 3% relative error across varying configurations while significantly reducing computational overhead.

## Introduction

Model fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization for ensemble methods typically require extensive computational resources. This research addresses the challenge of efficiently estimating ensemble performance without complete evaluation.

## Methodology

### Experimental Setup

- **Datasets**: Multiple benchmark datasets with varying characteristics
- **Forest Configurations**: Different numbers of trees, max depth, and other hyperparameters
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Relative error, computational time savings

## Key Results

- **Accuracy**: Less than 3% relative error in accuracy estimation
- **Efficiency**: Significant reduction in computational overhead
- **Robustness**: Consistent performance across different configurations
- **Generalization**: Framework applicable to various bagging-based ensembles

## Theoretical Contributions
