Track Complexity Management: Verstappen shows more consistent performance on complex tracks Lower sensitivity to number of corners and maximum curvature More efficient adaptation to track characteristics Tire Management Verstappen demonstrates superior tire management. Tire Management: Verstappen demonstrates superior tire management, Lower lap time degradation with tire wear More consistent performance across tire compounds Performance Factors Different sensitivity to track temperatures and weather conditions"
